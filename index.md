I'm a Postdoctoral researcher at Texas A&M University, in the Department of Aerospace Engineering. My primary interests are high-order methods, shock-capturing, turbomachinery, and GPU computing.

This website is mainly aimed at being a useful repository of information for myself, but hopefully someone else might find something interesting.
