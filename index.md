I'm a Postdoctoral researcher with IBM Research at the Hartree Centre. My
primary interests are high-order methods, shock-capturing, turbomachinery, and
GPU computing.

This website is mainly aimed at being a useful repository of information for
myself, but hopefully someone else might find something interesting.
